go run *.go config.env
```

### List audio devices
```bash
cd cmd/udarp
go run *.go -l
```

### Decoding with test data<br>
```bash
cd cmd/udarp
./scripts/testStdin.sh < samples/test.raw
```

### RigCtl (Hamlib) https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib
 Hamlibs' rigctld is used to control the radios PTT and frequency, and the binaries for it can be found in pkg/txControl/bin, which are embedded into the binary at compile time. UDARP automatically determines the OS and architecture and uses the correct binary to start rigctld.
